# JobFinder

## Project Announcement: JobFinder ðŸš€

We are excited to announce that the **JobFinder** application is now live! This platform seamlessly integrates the back-end API and front-end interface to deliver a complete solution for connecting organizations and job seekers.

- **Explore the Application**: [JobFinder Application](https://diman-job-ui.vercel.app)
- **API Documentation**: [JobFinder API Documentation](https://diman-job-finder-fast-api-tpmk.onrender.com/docs)

#### Note
The back-end API is hosted on Render's free plan. Because of this, the initial access can take anywhere from **30 to 50 seconds** to load. We appreciate your patience!

#### Contributors
- **Back-End Development**: Developed by [Dimitar Draganov](https://github.com/draganovdimitar2) (me), the back-end API is built using FastAPI for performance and scalability.
- **Front-End Development**: Big thanks to [realun00](https://github.com/realun00), who designed and implemented the front-end with intuitive and responsive user interface.

Thank you for supporting JobFinder, and stay tuned for future updates and enhancements!
