# JobFinder

## Project Announcement: JobFinder ðŸš€

We are excited to announce that the **JobFinder** application is now live! This platform seamlessly integrates the back-end API and front-end interface to deliver a complete solution for connecting organizations and job seekers.

- **Explore the Application**: [JobFinder Application](https://diman-job-ui.vercel.app)
- **API Documentation**: [JobFinder API Documentation](https://diman-job-finder-fast-api-tpmk.onrender.com/docs)

#### Note
The back-end API is hosted on Render's free plan. Because of this, the initial access can take anywhere from **30 to 50 seconds** to load. We appreciate your patience!

> **New Requirement**  
> The application now **requires an Azure account** because user avatars are stored in Azure Blob Storage.  
> Youâ€™ll need to configure your Azure Storage account and set the required environment variables (see the `.env` example below).

#### Contributors
- **Back-End Development**: Developed by [Dimitar Draganov](https://github.com/draganovdimitar2) (me), the back-end API is built using FastAPI for performance and scalability.
- **Front-End Development**: Big thanks to [realun00](https://github.com/realun00), who designed and implemented the front-end with intuitive and responsive user interface.

Thank you for supporting JobFinder, and stay tuned for future updates and enhancements!
## Project Overview

The Job Finder API application will feature two types of users: **Organizations** and **Regular Users**. Each role will be able to perform the following operations:

### 1. Regular User
- **View Job Postings**: Can view existing job postings.
- **Apply for Jobs**: Can apply for active job postings.
- **Like Job Postings**: Can like an existing active job posting.
- **View Application Status**: Can see a list of all job postings they have applied for, including whether they have been approved or not.
- **Manage Account**: Can change their account information (name, password).
- **Deactivate Account**: Can deactivate (delete) their account.
- **Upload Avatar** (new!)

### 2. Organization
- **View Job Postings**: Can view existing job postings.
- **Publish Job Postings**: Can publish job postings (edit and delete their own postings).
- **View Applicants**: Can view a list of candidates who have applied for a specific job posting.
- **Manage Applications**: Can approve or reject candidates.
- **Deactivate Account**: Can deactivate (delete) their account, which will make all their job postings inactive.
- **Upload Avatar** (new!)

## Notification Center
The JobFinder API includes a notification center powered by webhooks. Notifications are triggered in the following cases:

- When a job posting is liked.
- When an application is submitted.
- When the status of an application changes (approved/rejected).

This ensures that both job seekers and organizations stay updated on relevant actions in real time.

## Technical Requirements

Each object must meet the following requirements:

### 1. User
- **Attributes**: Unique identifier, name, email, password.
- **Applications**: A user can apply for multiple job postings.
- **Like**: A user can like a specific job posting only once.
- **Profile picture**: Can upload and delete avatar.


### 2. Organization
- **Attributes**: Unique identifier, name, email, password.
- **Job Postings**: An organization can publish multiple job postings.
- **User Approval**: An organization can approve only one user for a specific job posting.
- **Profile picture**: Can upload and delete avatar.

### 3. Job Posting
- **Attributes**: Unique identifier, title, description, number of likes, type of job (part-time, full-time, remote), and category (e.g., Office Administration, Development).
- **Category**: A job posting can belong to only one category.
- **Applicants**: A list of all users who have applied for the posting, along with their approval status.
